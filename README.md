# GettingAndCleaningData
The repository for my project for getting and cleaning data

This repository contains Three files files"

1) This readme file

2) run_analysis.R - the script for this work

3) codebook.md - the codebook for my work

My run_analysis file is well commented (I hope), and early in the code it sets the working directory, so be sure your data lives where the workring directory is set.
