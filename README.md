# GettingAndCleaningData
The repository for my project for getting and cleaning data

This repository should contain three files:

1) This readme file

2) run_analysis.R - the script for this work

3) codebook.md - the codebook for this work, including references to the data

My run_analysis file is well commented (I hope), so this readme file will be thinner due to the comments in my script.  

Early in the code it sets the working directory, so the data needs to live in the directory marked in set(wd) or it needs to be changed in the script.
