# GettingAndCleaningData
The repository for my project for getting and cleaning data

This repository contains Three files files"

1) This readme file

2) run_analysis.R - the script for this work

3) codebook.md - the codebook for this work

My run_analysis file is well commented (I hope), and early in the code it sets the working directory, so the data needs to live in the directory marked in set(wd) or it needs to be changed in the script.
